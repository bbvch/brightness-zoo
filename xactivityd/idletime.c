/*!
 * This function works around an XServer idleTime bug in the
 * XScreenSaverExtension if dpms is running. In this case the current
 * dpms-state time is always subtracted from the current idletime.
 * This means: XScreenSaverInfo->idle is not the time since the last
 * user activity, as descriped in the header file of the extension.
 * This result in SUSE bug # and sf.net bug #. The bug in the XServer itself
 * is reported at https://bugs.freedesktop.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=6439.
 *
 * Workaround: Check if if XServer is in a dpms state, check the
 *             current timeout for this state and add this value to
 *             the current idle time and return.
 *
 * \param _idleTime a unsigned long value with the current idletime from
 *                  XScreenSaverInfo->idle
 * \return a unsigned long with the corrected idletime
