Feature: Set brightness depending on the current ambient light
  As a user
  I want to be able to have an adequate brightness
  In order to see the screen in the night and in direct sunlight

Scenario Outline: Set the brightness depending on the ambient light
  Given I start dummy-brightnessd
  And I have a directory "device"
  And I have a file "device/in_illuminance_input" with the content "<ambient>"

  When I run ambientlightd with the device "device"

  Then I expect the property "percentage" of brightnessd to be <brightness>

  Examples:
    | ambient | brightness |
    |   25000 |        100 |
    |       1 |         10 |
    |  100000 |        100 |
    |   10000 |         46 |
    |    1000 |         14 |
    |       0 |         10 |

Scenario Outline: Use the conversion parameter from the configuration file
  Given I write "minAmbient=<min ambient>" to the ambientlightd configuration file
  And I write "maxAmbient=<max ambient>" to the ambientlightd configuration file
  And I write "minBrightness=<min brigthness>" to the ambientlightd configuration file
  And I write "maxBrightness=<max brigthness>" to the ambientlightd configuration file
  And I start dummy-brightnessd
  And I have a directory "device"
  And I have a file "device/in_illuminance_input" with the content "<ambient>"

  When I run ambientlightd with the device "device"

  Then I expect the property "percentage" of brightnessd to be <brightness>

  Examples:
    | min ambient | max ambient | min brigthness | max brigthness | ambient | brightness |
    |          10 |       10010 |             20 |             80 |       0 |         20 |
    |           1 |       25000 |             10 |            100 |   10000 |         46 |
    |          10 |       10010 |             20 |             80 |    5010 |         50 |
    |          10 |       10010 |             20 |             80 |   20000 |         80 |
    |           1 |       25000 |             90 |             10 |   10000 |         58 |

Scenario: ambientlightd prints an error when the ambient light sensor is not available
  Given I start dummy-brightnessd

  When I run ambientlightd with the argument "--device=/sys/not-here"

  Then I expect the string "file "/sys/not-here/in_illuminance_input" not found" on stderr from ambientlightd

Scenario Outline: print information to standard output in verbose mode
  Given I start dummy-brightnessd
  And I have a directory "device"
  And I have a file "device/in_illuminance_input" with the content "<ambient>"

  When I run ambientlightd with the device "device" and argument "--verbose"

  Then I expect the string "read ambient value <ambient>" on stdout from ambientlightd
  And I expect the string "write brightness value <brightness>" on stdout from ambientlightd

  Examples:
    | ambient | brightness |
    |   25000 |        100 |
    |       1 |         10 |
    |  100000 |        100 |
    |   10000 |         46 |
    |    1000 |         14 |
    |       0 |         10 |
